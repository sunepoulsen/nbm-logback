OpenIDE-Module-Name=Logback
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Wrapper module for the logback system.
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project. It was designed \
  by Ceki Gülcü, log4j's founder. It builds upon a decade of experience gained in designing industrial-strength \
  logging systems. The resulting product, i.e. logback, is faster and has a smaller footprint than all existing \
  logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin. Just as importantly, logback offers unique and rather useful features \
  missing in other logging systems.
